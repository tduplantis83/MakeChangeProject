## Make Change Project

### First week homework for Skill Distillery
Course Began: 9/9/19
Assigned: 9/13/19
Completed: 9/13/19

### Overview
This program simulates a cash transaction interface.

In the cash register we were assigned to calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We were also told to notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) was needed to make the change for the customer. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed.

### How to run
This is a console app:
1. Compile and run it in Terminal, an IDE, etc.
2. Input the item price (& return), followed by the amount tendered (& return).
3. The Item Price and Amount Tendered will be reformatted as currency and displayed in the console, along with the amount of change due, and the proper bills and coins used to make that change.

### Lessons Learned
I learned the importance of working out the app logic prior to starting coding.
I also learned to utilize the entire first week of material from Skill Distillery.
